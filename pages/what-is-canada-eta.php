					<h2>What is eTA?</h2>
					
				</div>
				
			</div>
			
			<p>An electronic Travel Authority (eTA) is a new entry requirement for visa-exempt foreign nationals travelling to Canada by air that is electronically linked to your passport. The authorization is valid for five years or until the travellerâ€™s passport expires, whichever comes first.    </p>
			
			<p>A valid eTA and travel document (passport) will facilitate your entry to Canada. When you arrive at the border, a border services officer will ask to see your passport or travel documents and ask you a few questions.The officer will then decide if you can enter Canada.    </p>
			
			<p>To make an application for an eTA through this website you need your valid passport, email address and a credit card.    </p>

					<h2>How long can I stay In Canada?</h2>
					
				</div>
				
			</div>
			
			<p>Most visitors are allowed a maximum six-month stay. A border services officer at the port of entry will determine how long exactly you can stay in Canada at your arrival and indicate in your passport the date by which you must leave Canada.    </p>
			
			<p>If you want to stay longer than your authorized stay, you should apply for an extension at least 30 days before the authorized end of your stay.    </p>

			<p>If you do not hold a passport from any of the eligible countries, you cannot apply for an eTA online. You might be eligible to apply for other types of visas directly with a Canadian Visa office.    </p>
