				<p>The eTA Authorization System, performs checks against law enforcement databases. All travelers seeking admission to Canada are required to obtain an electronic travel authorization using this system prior to being granted boarding.</p>
					
				<p>If your eTA travel authorization application is approved, it establishes that you are eligible to travel, but does not establish that you are admissible to Canada. Upon arrival to Canada, you will be inspected by a Border Officer at a port of entry who may determine that you are inadmissible for any reason under Canadian law.</p>
				
				<p>A determination that you are not eligible for eTA travel authorization does not preclude you from applying for a visa to travel to Canada.</p>
				
				<p>All information provided by you, or on your behalf by a designated third party, must be true and correct. An eTA travel authorization may be revoked at any time and for any reason, such as new information influencing eligibility. You may be subject to administrative or criminal penalties if you knowingly and willfully make a materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation in an electronic travel authorization application submitted by you or on your behalf.</p>
